---

### **Step 4: Let Us Do the Math**

#### Auto-Calculations:

**For Spend-Based Categories (1, 2, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15):**
1. Enter what you bought
2. Enter how much you spent
3. Select the industry sector
4. ✨ Emission factor loads automatically from database
5. We calculate: `Spend × Emission Factor = Emissions`

**Example:**
```
Office Supplies Purchase:
- What: Office Supplies
- Spend: $50,000
- Sector: OFFICE (auto-selected)
- Factor: 0.40 kg CO₂e per $ (auto-loaded)
- Result: 50,000 × 0.40 = 20,000 kg CO₂e = 20 tonnes CO₂e
```

**For Activity-Based Categories (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12):**
- Enter the activity (km traveled, kg waste, etc.)
- Select the type from dropdown
- Emission factor loads automatically
- We calculate: `Activity × Emission Factor = Emissions`

**Example:**
```
Business Flight:
- Type: Flight — Short haul (<1500 km)
- Distance: 5,000 km
- Factor: 0.255 kg CO₂e per km (auto-loaded)
- Result: 5,000 × 0.255 = 1,275 kg CO₂e = 1.28 tonnes CO₂e
```

### **Step 5: Save & Continue**

After entering data for a category:

1. Click **"Save & Continue"** button
2. ✅ Calculator validates your data
3. 📊 Updates your total emissions
4. ➡️ Moves to next category automatically

## 💡 Pro Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Start with What You Know**
Don't feel pressured to complete all 15 categories at once!
- Start with categories you have data for
- Come back to others later
- Your progress is auto-saved

### 2. **Use Templates Smartly**
- Templates are based on typical businesses
- Adjust the numbers to match your actual spending/activity
- Delete rows that don't apply, add rows for specific items

### 3. **Don't Overthink Emission Factors**
- The system auto-loads factors from authoritative sources (EPA, DEFRA, IPCC)
- You don't need to research or calculate factors manually
- Focus on accurate activity data (spending, distance, quantities)

### 4. **Break It Into Sessions**
- Do 3-5 categories per session
- Take breaks between sessions
- Your work is saved automatically

### 5. **Use the Examples**
- Click "Quick Start Examples" buttons
- Adjust the amounts to match your business
- Much faster than starting from scratch

### 6. **Skip What Doesn't Apply**
Not every category applies to every business:
- **Manufacturing:** Categories 1-5, 7, 9 likely apply
- **Office/Services:** Categories 1, 6, 7 are most relevant
- **Retail:** Categories 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12 matter most

### 7. **Review Before Final Save**
- Click "View Results" to see summary
- Check categories with highest emissions
- Verify numbers make sense for your business size
